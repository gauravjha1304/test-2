    <h1>I. Types of Patient monitor</h1>
    <h2>1. Patient monitor</h2>
    <p>A patient monitor is also called a medical monitor, a physiological monitor or a display, which is an electronic
        medical device. This instrument can measure the patient's vital signs, display the data obtained therefrom, and
        transmit it on the monitoring network.</p>
    <h2>2.Vital signs monitor </h2>
    <p>An intuitive touch screen monitor can be used to improve workflow and training. It is suitable for most
        low-sensitivity medical environments and clinical workflows, and can measure pulse, blood oxygen saturation,
        non-invasive blood pressure, temperature, EtCo2, respiration, etc. </p>
    <h2>3. End-tidal carbon dioxide monitor</h2>
    <P>It is an instrument used to measure end-tidal carbon dioxide (EtCO2). At the end of exhalation, a non-invasive
        technique is used to measure the partial pressure or maximum concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2).When
        purchasing the patient monitors, it's better to learn about their respective functions in advance and choose
        qualified patient monitor suppliers.</P>
    <h1>Ⅱ. Functional classifications of patient monitors</h1>
    <p>According to the function classification, there are three types of bedside monitors, central monitors and
        discharged monitors. They are divided into intelligent and non-intelligent.</p>
    <h2>1. Bedside monitor</h2>
    <P>It is an instrument connected to the patient's bedside and can continuously monitor various physiological
        parameters or certain states of the patient. The bedside monitor can display data, alarm and record information,
        and it can also work as a whole with the central patient monitor.</P>
    <h2>2. Central monitor</h2>
    <p>The central monitor consists of the main monitor and several bedside monitors. The main monitor can control the
        work of each bedside monitor, and monitor the conditions of multiple subjects at the same time. Its
        characteristic is that it can complete the automatic recording of various abnormal physiological parameters and
        medical records.</p>
    <h2> 3. Discharge monitor</h2>
    <p>The out-of-hospital monitor is generally a small electronic patient monitor machine that the patient can carry
        with him. The instrument can continuously monitor certain physiological parameters of patients inside and
        outside the hospital, which can be used as a reference for doctors in diagnosis.</p>
    <h1>Ⅲ. Clinical applications of patient monitors</h1>
    <h2>1. The scope of clinical application of medical monitoring equipment</h2>
    <p>According to clinical nursing objects, the following types of nursing wards have been developed and designed:
        intraoperative and postoperative nursing wards, psychiatric wards, trauma nursing wards, coronary heart disease
        nursing wards, pediatric and neonatal wards, renal dialysis wards, hyperbaric oxygen chambers Intensive care
        unit and patient care unit of radiotherapy machine. Clinically, various dedicated monitoring systems are
        equipped in departments and wards as needed</p>
    <h2>2. The following are currently widely used automatic monitoring systems</h2>
    <p>Automatic monitoring system during operation, automatic monitoring system after operation, automatic monitoring
        system for trauma care ward, automatic monitoring system for coronary heart disease, automatic monitoring system
        for delivery room, automatic monitoring system for critically ill patients, automatic monitoring system for
        neonates and premature infants, automatic hyperbaric oxygen chamber monitoring system.
